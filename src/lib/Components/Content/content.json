    "Hero": "Owner | Certified Dog Trainer | Over 19 Years of Experience | Specialized in confidence building, aggression, resource guarding, and more",
    "Your Trainer": [
      "Welcome to the Heart of Dogs by Nature! When you come train with me your dog becomes part of my pack and I will do everything I can to set both you and your dog up for success. Respecting your dog for who they are while still setting boundaries, creating clear communication, and getting you both prepared for life. Although I am a balanced trainer it is 99% positive and game-based training. I take time to get to know you and your dog before just recommending a tool to use and no matter what we use I take the time to make sure your dog fully understands what the tool even is whether its a martingale, slip lead, prong collar, E-collar, or harness",
      "I started dog training in 2005. My Grandfather trained police dogs and competed in many sporting events. I would spend my summers helping him at the kennel learning as much as I could from him, helping him with obedience and scent detection training at his business. Those summers really sparked my passion for dog training. Seeing the lightbulb go off in the dog's head when they finally understand what is being asked of them, is still my favorite part of training today!",
      "When I left for college, I decided to pursue a different direction with dogs and stepped into the world of rescue dogs. I had to completely change my style of training as I was no longer dealing with self-confident bullheaded dogs. With rescues, I found myself working to rehabilitate many reactive, aggressive, and fearful dogs. I had to learn to build their confidence, and understand dogs' body language, and their psychology to help them overcome their issues so they could be available for adoption. Common behaviors I worked with were resource guarding, people reactivity, dog reactivity, and fear-based aggression. With some dogs, I had to be aware of the smallest change in behavior or an accident could happen. Although I can never promise that a dog will be 100% friendly, that does not mean that pup can't calmly walk past its triggers and ignore them.",
      "In 2018, I took a step back from the rescue world to focus on my rescue dog, Louie, who was having some health problems. As she recovered, it was time for me to get a second dog, I knew that I wanted to step back into the dog sports world again! I am currently an active competitor in multiple venues UKC, ADBA, AADRI, and CPE sports. So far I have titled my young dog, Ari, in rally obedience, weight pull, conformation, barn hunt, trick dog, lure coursing, nose work, agility, shed hunting, and dock diving! I've also trained him as a diabetic alert service dog. In our free time, we enjoy urban mushing! Our current training goals are to achieve titles in competitive obedience, tracking, and freestyle. Ari is also my little helper dog in class so we can help teach your pup how to calmly walk by another dog before throwing you directly into a group class",
      "From 2021 until 2024, I joined Dog Training Personalized where I was the head dog trainer working with pet dogs of all different backgrounds and behavioral issues. Here my specialty and passion has become working with resource guarding, dog aggression, human aggression, confidence building, and teaching over-excited dogs to relax. But who doesn't also enjoy a happy-go-lucky, self-confident dog in class? Although I am still working very closely with Dog Training Personalized it is time for me to begin my own training program. Dogs by Nature has been a dream of mine for years and I am so excited to get it started where I can help even more dogs, especially those who need to learn how to be a dog vs fitting into a criteria.",
      "Each dog whom I have worked with has taught me something new. When we train together, I will teach you and your dog how to relax, build a partnership, and communicate with each other while still giving your dog clear boundaries. My goal is for the two of you to enjoy life together and reach your goals!",
      "I am also a certified evaluator for AKC Canine Good Citizen, AKC Urban Canine Good Citizen, AKC Community Canine, AKC STAR Puppy, and an AKC Trick Dog. Along with being a founding member and board member of the Ohio Valley APBT Club."

          "Louie is the original Dogs by Nature dog and is pictured in my logo even. She is my elder rescue Pit/Am Bulldog mix, who I fostered failed back in 2015. When I brought her home she had horrible fear aggression. Any loud sounds or fast movement was a trigger for her and if you were standing too close to her she would be going after you. She was also a dog that had no food or toy motivation so working and building that up was a challenge in itself. For her obedience was the last thing we were worried about but instead, I focused on building her confidence, her trust, and teaching her how to be a dog. After I built her up to the point you would never have known she was ever fearful we then focused on obedience! She went on to become a narcotics detection dog, glucose alert dog, and my demo dog to help train hundreds of other rescues. Although she's much slower now and prefers to sleep on the couch all day she is still active and enjoys hiking and going on sniff walks."

He competes and trains in obedience, rally obedience, nose work, dock dive, weight pull, agility, shed hunting, trick dog, conformation, tracking, article detection, barn hunt, lure coursing and so much more! The title I am most proud of him for is his UKC Rally Obedience Masters title as that took years of dedication and hard work to achieve! He is also my current demo dog that you will meet in class as we work on being more neutral with other dogs and a fully trained service dog and is trained to alert to glucose change",
          "Although I have accomplished so much with Ari a lot of the sports we are active in are positive outlets to let him just be a dog so when I need him to be calm and focus he is on it! As genetically he is still my crazy working terrier! For example, he loves to pull so I taught him to weight pull and bikerjorging so he can get that out of his system.",

  "FAQ": {
    "How often a day do you recommend working with your dog?": "I recommend working with your dog for 5-15 mins 1-3x a day. So if you have a busy day and all you have time for is a quick 5-minute session, great! Just have fun with your dog! As you progress with your training, everything you learn should become part of your everyday life and become second nature.",
    "How often should we meet for private lessons?": "Depends on how busy your life is and how old your dog is. For most adult dogs' I like to meet once a week while for puppies we like to meet every other week to give them time to work through the puppy goldfish brain. My main concern is whether you've accomplished your homework and if your dog is ready to move on to the next steps. So we can adjust the time between our lessons as needed.",
    "When can I join group classes?": "You're welcome to join group classes once you have approval from your trainer to join them. Dogs who need more confidence might join the confidence-building group before they even start private lessons' while others might not begin any group classes until after they've finished their private lessons. It fully depends on your dog and what they need.",
    "What if I want to continue group classes after my training packages?": "Awesome! After your package has been completed group classes are only $30 per. We have some clients who come once a week while others only stop in every so often for a refresher.",
    "What if I want to continue private lessons after my training package?": "Of course! We are here for the life of your dog so, if you ever have any problems or questions feel free to reach out! But if you need an add-on private lesson they are $125 per.",
    "What is your training style?": "We are balanced trainers. This means that we teach everything using fun and positive methods by shaping and marker training but, when our dogs do understand what is expected of them but are pushing boundaries we can correct them whether it's a method of just removing them, telling them no, using our leash, or using an eCollar. But before we correct a dog it is important that they understand what is expected out of them, what pressure is, how to turn it off, and how to get what they want first. So we aren't just slapping on a tool and correcting our dogs either its all a taught process.",
    "Can I make payment plans?": "We try to ask for the payment upfront before training begins. But, we understand times are tough now, so we offer the option of paying 1/2 upfront and then the second half by the 3rd lesson.",
    "Do you offer discounts?": "Yes, as a thank you, we offer a 5% discount to the military, veterans, first responders, nurses, and rescue dogs."
